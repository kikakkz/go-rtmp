# go-rtmp
Working in progress, coming soon. Currently a easy server interface is supported by a bundle of APIs and events. In feature, it'll be a go library. Different from C librtmp, the code of go-rtmp is absolutly easy to understand. Sample code could be found in server.go to construct a rtmp server.
